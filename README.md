# DFTOY
This repository implements a simplified 1D Density Functional Theory (DFT) solver for teaching, concept verification, and numerical tests. It performs a Kohnâ€“Sham self-consistent cycle: builds the effective potential, assembles the Hamiltonian, solves for the ground state, updates the density, and iterates until convergence.
